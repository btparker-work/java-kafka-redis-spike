Choosing between Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver) and Spring Data Reactive Redis depends on your application's architecture and requirements. Hereâ€™s how you can decide:

1. Understanding the Two Options
Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver)
Supports synchronous, asynchronous, and reactive usage.
Uses Lettuce or Jedis as Redis drivers.
Suitable for traditional (blocking) Spring Boot applications.
Best for: General-purpose Redis usage in most scenarios.
Spring Data Reactive Redis
Designed for fully reactive applications using Project Reactor.
Works well with Spring WebFlux (reactive web framework).
Uses non-blocking I/O operations.
Best for: High-throughput, event-driven applications needing reactive programming.
2. How to Decide?
âœ… Use Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver) if...
Your application uses Spring MVC (Servlet-based).
You are working with blocking synchronous operations.
Your Redis usage is simple caching, pub/sub, or session storage.
You want compatibility with existing Spring Boot applications.
You are using Jedis or Lettuce as your Redis driver.
ðŸ‘‰ Example usage (Synchronous Redis Operations):

JAVA
@Autowired
private StringRedisTemplate redisTemplate;

public void saveData(String key, String value) {
    redisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, value);
}

public String getData(String key) {
    return redisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
}
âœ… Use Spring Data Reactive Redis if...
Your application is built with Spring WebFlux.
You need non-blocking, reactive programming for high-performance applications.
You are handling a large number of concurrent connections.
You are building event-driven microservices.
ðŸ‘‰ Example usage (Reactive Redis Operations):

JAVA
@Autowired
private ReactiveStringRedisTemplate reactiveRedisTemplate;

public Mono<Void> saveData(String key, String value) {
    return reactiveRedisTemplate.opsForValue().set(key, value);
}

public Mono<String> getData(String key) {
    return reactiveRedisTemplate.opsForValue().get(key);
}
3. Performance Considerations
Feature	Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver)	Spring Data Reactive Redis
Blocking/Non-Blocking	Blocking (Traditional)	Non-Blocking (Reactive)
Best for	CRUD, Caching, Pub/Sub	High-throughput, event-driven apps
Spring Framework	Works with Spring MVC	Works with Spring WebFlux
Performance	Good for most use cases	Better for high concurrency
Complexity	Easier to implement	Requires reactive programming knowledge
4. Conclusion
If your Spring Boot app is MVC-based and doesnâ€™t use WebFlux, stick with Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver).
If you are building a fully reactive application with Spring WebFlux, then go for Spring Data Reactive Redis.
ðŸš€ My Recommendation:
If you are unsure, start with Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver) because it is simpler and widely used. Move to Spring Data Reactive Redis only if you need high scalability and non-blocking operations.

do I need both of the libraries or only Spring Reactive Redis?

Do You Need Both Libraries or Just Spring Data Reactive Redis?
The answer depends on your application's architecture and whether you need both synchronous and reactive Redis support.

1. If You Are Building a Fully Reactive Application (Spring WebFlux)
ðŸ‘‰ Only use Spring Data Reactive Redis.

If your entire application is based on Spring WebFlux and follows a reactive programming model (using Mono and Flux), then you only need Spring Data Reactive Redis.
This ensures that all Redis operations are non-blocking, aligning with your reactive stack.
âœ… Include in pom.xml (Maven):

XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive</artifactId>
</dependency>
2. If Your Application Uses Both Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux
ðŸ‘‰ Use Both Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver) and Spring Data Reactive Redis.

If your application has both blocking (Spring MVC) and non-blocking (Spring WebFlux) components, then you might need both libraries.
Example: You have REST APIs using Spring MVC but also some event-driven, reactive microservices.
âœ… Include both dependencies in pom.xml:

XML
<!-- For Synchronous (Blocking) Redis -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- For Reactive (Non-Blocking) Redis -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive</artifactId>
</dependency>
3. If Your Application Is Traditional (Spring MVC)
ðŸ‘‰ Only use Spring Data Redis (Access+Driver).

If your application is not reactive and built using Spring MVC (Servlet-based), then you donâ€™t need the reactive library.
The blocking Redis client (StringRedisTemplate or RedisTemplate) works perfectly for caching, session management, etc.
âœ… Include only the synchronous dependency:

XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
4. How to Decide?
Application Type	Which Redis Library to Use?
Spring Boot (Spring MVC)	âœ… spring-boot-starter-data-redis
Spring Boot (Spring WebFlux)	âœ… spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive
Hybrid (Both MVC & WebFlux)	âœ… Use both dependencies
Final Answer:
If your app is fully reactive (WebFlux) â†’ Only use spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive.
If your app is traditional (Spring MVC) â†’ Only use spring-boot-starter-data-redis.
If your app mixes both blocking and reactive parts â†’ Use both.
