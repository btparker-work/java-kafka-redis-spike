I have 200,000 records with 20 columns I want to cache in redis cache ZSET with a tag for each column so that I may filter and sort as client requires. How fast can I expect to be able to filter this data based on column values I pass? Will this be performant if I want to get the top record per one column tag value?

Performance of Filtering & Sorting 200,000 Records in Redis ZSET
Using Redis Sorted Sets (ZSETs) for filtering and sorting 200,000 records with 20 columns, where each column acts as a tag, can be efficient depending on the filtering strategy. However, Redis is not optimized for multi-dimensional filtering and sorting like a relational database.

1. Understanding Redis ZSET Performance
ZSETs (ZADD, ZRANGE, ZREVRANGE, ZSCORE) are fast because they use a skip list data structure.
Filtering by a single column value is fast (~O(log N) complexity).
Sorting is built-in for ZSETs (sorted by score).
Multi-column filtering is not natively efficient in Redis.
Expected Performance (Single Column Filter)
Operation	Command	Time Complexity	Expected Performance
Insert record	ZADD	O(log N)	Fast (~ms per record)
Get top record by score	ZREVRANGE	O(log N + M)	Fast (~ms response)
Filter by range	ZRANGEBYSCORE	O(log N + M)	Fast (~ms response)
Filter by multiple tags	Requires multiple ZINTER	O(N)	Slower
👉 Retrieving the ‘top’ record based on a single column (score) is very fast (~milliseconds).
👉 Filtering by multiple columns is slower because Redis doesn’t natively support complex queries.

2. Recommended Redis ZSET Approach
Since you need filtering and sorting per column, you can structure the data in multiple ZSETs:

Data Storage Strategy
One ZSET per column (for sorting and filtering)
A hash (or JSON) to store full record details
📌 Example Structure:

users_by_age (ZSET) → ZADD users_by_age 30 user:123 ✅ (Sort by age)
users_by_salary (ZSET) → ZADD users_by_salary 50000 user:123 ✅ (Sort by salary)
user:123 (HASH/JSON) → {id: 123, name: "John", age: 30, salary: 50000, ...}
Querying Data
Get top user by age → ZREVRANGE users_by_age 0 0 (O(log N + M))
Get users within age 25-35 → ZRANGEBYSCORE users_by_age 25 35 (O(log N + M))
Get users with multiple conditions → Use ZINTERSTORE (O(N))
3. Performance Bottlenecks & Optimization
🚀 Fastest Use Cases
✅ Sorting & retrieving top records quickly (e.g., top user by age).
✅ Filtering by a single column (e.g., users between 25-35 years old).

⚠️ Slower Use Cases
❌ Filtering by multiple columns (e.g., age + salary) → Requires ZINTERSTORE (O(N)).
❌ Complex queries requiring filtering & sorting dynamically → Redis does not support SQL-like queries efficiently.

🔥 Optimization Tips
Precompute frequently used filters and store them separately.
Use Bloom Filters to reduce lookup time for possible matches.
Consider RediSearch if complex filtering is required.
4. Alternative Approaches
If dynamic filtering and sorting across multiple fields is required, Redis may not be the best tool. Consider:

Elasticsearch (supports full-text search, filtering, and sorting efficiently).
PostgreSQL with caching (if relational queries are needed).
RediSearch (advanced filtering & indexing for Redis).
5. Final Verdict: Is Redis ZSET Good for Your Use Case?
Use Case	Redis ZSET Performance
Sort & get top record by one field	✅ Very Fast (~ms)
Filter by a single field range	✅ Fast (~ms)
Filter by multiple fields dynamically	⚠️ Slower (~O(N))
Complex filtering & sorting	❌ Not optimal, use RediSearch or Elasticsearch
➡️ If you only need to sort/filter by single fields at a time, Redis is great (sub-millisecond response).
➡️ If you need multi-column filtering dynamically, Redis alone may not be performant.

🚀 Recommendation
Use Redis ZSETs for fast single-column filtering & sorting.
Use RediSearch if multi-column filtering is needed.
Consider Elasticsearch if complex queries are required.
